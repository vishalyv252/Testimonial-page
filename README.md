# ResponsiveTestimonialPage

This project was generated with Angular CLI as the version of 17.2.1. I styled the layout using Tailwind CSS. I had written some parts of code in Typescript based on Loops and Objects for displaying the data in HTML. So please refer the code properly. I attached screenshots in this repository.

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
